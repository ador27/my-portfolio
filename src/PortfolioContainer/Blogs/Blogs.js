                        Authentication is common way to handle security for all applications. This is only way to answer the question “who you are?” to the application, when comes to stateless architecture or service oriented architecture we got lot of new concepts and technologies in the market. In this article we will learn how to handle authentication on RESTful APIs. Authentication:
                        Lets start by listing the various ways through which we can achieve authentication, Cookie-Based authentication Token-Based authentication Third party access(OAuth, API-token) OpenId SAML</h3>

Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend.</h3>
